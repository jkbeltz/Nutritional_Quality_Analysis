This repository contains all codes and raw data files for generating the figures in the main body and supplemental
materials. Data files contained in "Raw", code is designed to be run O20_AB_fig1.R, then O20_AB_fig2.R, followed 
by the Haldanes, and PCAPheno files. The final version of Figure 2 is generated in O20-Haldanes, and figure 3 in 
ClusterHeatMap. 

Microbial analysis conducted uysing R and QIIME2 pipeline, following (https://github.com/jbisanz/16Spipelines.git),  16s Sequence Data found in the Raw Folder.
